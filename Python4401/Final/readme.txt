Hello, I'm Ashton Wooster, and this is my final project for Python 1.

I made a perlin noise algorithm visualizer, rendered with turtle.

Inside Main.py, there are a couple of constants you can tweak to experiment with it.
    - I wouldn't set the pixel count past 100, as it can take a long time to render

Thank you for the fun semester!
